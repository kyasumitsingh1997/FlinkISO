                        <p><span>1) <strong>Creating Employee Master : </strong>To create an employee master, you can either upload your existing employee details via Import/Export functionality or you can also manually add / edit or delete employee details. (Refer to IMPORT/EXPORT section on more help).</span></p>

                        <p><span>Once the employees are added to the system, you can then create "Users". It is not a must to create users for each employee. Users are only those employees who are required to login to FlinkISO and assigned ISO related tasks.</span></p>

                        <p><span>2) As per the standard procedure, each employee must under go "Induction Training" . You can add these training from "Training Conducted"
                                panel on the HR dashboard. Make sure you have added "Trainings, Courses, Course Types &amp; Training Types" before you add Induction details.
                                FlinkISO already has a "Induction Training" entry under "Courses/Trainings". You just need to map this training&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span>3) List of Trainers is one of the mandatory record you will require to keep. You can add existing as well as new trainers from HR dashboard "Trainers" panel.</span></p>

                            <span>Ans : Trainers can be divided into different types like "Internal Trainers","External Trainers", "Internal Technical Trainers" or "External Domain Experts" etc. If you would like to create additional trainer types you can create them from the same HR dashboard's Trainers panel by clicking on the "Trainer Type" link.</span></p>

                        <p>4) <strong>Training Need Identification :</strong></p>

                        <p>This is another mandatory record as per ISO standard.</p>

                        <p>Since you already have added trainings &amp; courses and the employee master, this application automatically links these two.</p>

                        <p>You just need to select an employee who needs a specific training, select that employee and the training required along with schedule (frequency of the trainings) and save the record.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>On TNI view, you will be able to see the TNI and all the trainings that employee has undergone since date.</p>
                        <p><?php echo $this->Html->Image('help-images/TNI.png'); ?>	</p>
                        <p><span>5) <strong>Courses :</strong> You can create courses like "Employee Inductions", "Technical Up-gradation Course" etc.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><strong><span>What is Course Types ?</span></strong><br>
                            <span>Ans : Courses you create can be under different categories like "Technical Courses", "Soft Skill Courses" etc. You can additionally create course types based on your industry &amp; organisation requirements.</span></p>

                        <p>6) <strong>Trainings Conducted :</strong> After your training need identification ( TNI ) is done for the respective employee, you will need to conduct/assign these training to the employee based on the schedule selected.</p>
